class_name BusGroup

# ======================================
# | This class was created to mitigate |
# | some of the messy code that was    |
# | in sounds.gd as of commit 2a4a272. |
# |                                    |
# | This class is meant to group       |
# | SoundGroups together into a        |
# | package that can be easily swapped |
# | between effects buses.             |
# ======================================
