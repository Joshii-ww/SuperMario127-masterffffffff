# Super Mario 127 Public Repository
 As of the 0.8.0 update, the SM127 legacy codebase is public and free to clone and use wherever you need!



### How to set-up SM127 using Godot 3.5.3:

- Download Godot 3.5.3 from [here](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/3.5.3-stable/). While you could attempt to transition the project from Godot 3 to Godot 4, we do not recommend it.
- Download the repository as zip, or fork the repository then clone it using the git software of your choice.
- Through Godot, open the `project.godot` file found in the source code.

  From there, you are free to edit the project as you wish!
